# Import Words From LinguaLeo to Anki

### Description ###

This is an add-on for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - powerful, intelligent flash cards, which makes remembering things easy.

The add-on downloads your dictionary from [LinguaLeo](https://lingualeo.com/) - another great resource to learn English and transforms it into Anki cards. Cards are created both for 'english to russian' and 'russian to english' sides and include pronunciation, images, transcription and context.

### Installation ###

To install this add-on, open Anki on your computer, go to the Tools menu and then Add-ons > Open Add-ons Folder and put the source code there. 

Watch this gif for the details (with russian captures):

### Usage ###

To download your words simply go to the Tools menu > Import from LinguaLeo, enter your login and password for the site and that's all. You don't need to create decks, models, templates or anything else. The add-on will make it all for you. As simple as that. 

You can also choose whether you want to download all words from your LinguaLeo dictionary or only unstudied ones.

Please, be patient, it can take up to 10 minutes to download 1000 words due to size of images and sounds. 

### Compatibility ###

This add-on only works with Anki's stable release branch (2.0.x â‰¥ 2.0.44). The 2.1 beta branch is not supported at this point in time.
